# CraSOS
### So you do not lie like trash after you crash…..


Our project is designed to reduce the number of casualties due to road accidents by using accident detection and awareness.

**Theme – Social Welfare**
CraSOS is a standalone device which can be fitted inside a car or on a helmet of the two-wheeler rider or integrated with any smart wear device.

## About the repository :

## * [CraSOS (Arduino Code)](../master/CraSOS (Arduino Code))
After the collision or accident is detected, this code is used to generate a SOS message containing the **location of the accident** and **important medical details (like blood group)**, and send it nearby helpline numbers and emergency family contacts.
